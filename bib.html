            <h2 class="fade">SILVA, Carlos, & Comfort F. RICKETTS. " Mega Sporting Events and Air Pollution: The Case of the Super Bowl." Journal of Environmental Management and Tourism [Online], 7.3 (2016): 504-511. Web. 13 Nov. 2023</h2>
            <p class="fade">This academic journal article presents a comprehensive study on the environmental impact of hosting major sporting events, specifically focusing on the Super Bowl. The study analyzes changes in air quality (PM10 concentrations), around the event's location. Utilizing data from the EPA’s Air Quality System, the research employs statistical models to demonstrate a significant increase in air pollution on Super Bowl Sunday. The findings are crucial in understanding the broader environmental consequences of such large-scale events.</p>
            <p class="fade">From an evaluative standpoint, the article is a significant contribution to environmental studies, particularly in the context of pollution caused by American events. It highlights a frequently overlooked aspect of major sporting events – the environmental cost. The journal offers a clear correlation between the event and its environmental impact. This study is particularly relevant towards the research in my project, emphasizing the need for more sustainable practices in managing large-scale events.</p>
            <p class="fade">In terms of applicability, this research is highly relevant towards the analysis of how American culture (specifically large events) influences the environment. It provides empirical evidence that can be used for discussions regarding the environmental responsibilities of large event organizers. The study could also be important in developing classroom discussions or projects centered on environmental impact assessment.</p>

            <h2 class="fade">“Black Friday and the Climate Emergency.” The Ecologist, 27 Nov. 2020, theecologist.org/2020/nov/26/black-friday-and-climate-emergency.</h2>
            <p class="fade">This article from The Ecologist provides an in-depth analysis of the environmental impact of consumerism surrounding Black Friday. It explores how advertising causes overconsumption and its subsequent ecological footprint, drawing parallels with the historical battle against tobacco advertising. They argue that the promotion of high-carbon lifestyles through advertising contributes significantly to environmental degradation. The article is also critical and offers a perspective on how consumer culture, driven by materialistic values amplified by advertising can lead to unsustainable behaviors.</p>
            <p class="fade">Evaluating this article, it does a good job linking consumer behavior to broader environmental issues. It provides a unique perspective on the role of advertising in shaping consumer habits and its indirect contribution to ecological degradation. This makes it a valuable resource for understanding the complex relationship between consumer culture and environmental impact.</p>
            <p class=fade>This article is particularly relevant to my project since it offers a critical viewpoint on how events like Black Friday, fueled by aggressive advertising and consumer culture, contribute to environmental issues. The article's insights into the role of advertising in promoting unsustainable consumption patterns can be directly applied to analyze the environmental consequences of events like Black Friday. Additionally, the article's discussion on potential solutions to mitigate advertising's impact on the environment could offer valuable ideas towards addressing the problem within the project.</p>

            <h2 class="fade">Ivanova, Diana, et al. “Environmental impact assessment of household consumption.” Journal of Industrial Ecology, vol. 20, no. 3, 2015, pp. 526–536, https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.12371.</h2>
            <p class="fade">The article presents a detailed analysis of the environmental footprint of household consumption, focusing on material, water, and land use, as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.The study traces the origin of products consumed by households and represents global supply chains of 2007. It highlights that household consumption contributes to more than 60% of global GHG emissions and a significant portion of total land, material, and water use, with wealthier countries generating the most waste per capita. The study finds that transportation, housing, and food are the primary categories driving these environmental footprints, with food consumption (especially meat, dairy, and processed food) rising rapidly with income.</p>
            <p class="fade">This article is a critical resource for understanding the direct link between household consumption patterns and environmental degradation. Its comprehensive approach and use of a detailed database make it a robust source for quantifying the impact of consumer behavior on the environment. The findings are particularly relevant for policymakers and researchers focusing on sustainable consumption and environmental policy</p>
            <p class="fade">This article provides a foundational understanding of how everyday consumer choices contribute to environmental issues which I can relate to the other aspects of my project. It offers empirical evidence that can be used to contextualize the environmental consequences of events like Black Friday, which are characterized by heightened consumer activity. The insights into the disproportionate impact of wealthier countries and the specific categories of consumption that drive environmental footprints can be directly applied to analyze the environmental implications of American consumerism.</p>
